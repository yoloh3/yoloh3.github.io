# key takeaways 💭

I am falling in love with Chan as [[260127 . How to fall in love]]:
- I fall in love when someone sees me in a way I didn’t know I could be seen. Not just compliments, but like—recognition. As in: **I see the version of you that’s still trying, even when you pretend not to care. And I like her.**
- Falling in love is like seeing yourself reflected in someone else’s mind. It’s narcissism, sure. But also curiosity. The right person makes you want to know yourself better. And then, paradoxically, forget yourself entirely.
- I fall in love when I want them to fill all my pauses.
