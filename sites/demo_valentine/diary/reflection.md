# General
- I met Chan when she joined my old company (Quest Global Vietnam). She is a HR while I'm DFT engineer.
- I met Chan first around Apr 2024, I was some casual talk with her at that time. First at LinkedIn (picture in ./media/first_talk.jpg), then in facebook messenger.
- We met the vibe, felt fun to talk various topics.
- Then, we went to Nha Trang together with company for Company Trip. We had some deeper connection and had the first picture together (picture in ./media/first_picture.JPG)
- Then I moved to other company (Marvell) and couldn't meet her much. I also got stucked in my life with new environment, then I didn't contact with her much.
- Then, recently, around Sept 2025, as I had more positive energy, overcome stressed time, I re-connected with her and felt how we was the same vibe
- Then I tried to fliss her, and finally she pull back step by step.
