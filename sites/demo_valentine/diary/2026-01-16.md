# key takeaways 💭

Yesterday was a productive day. I wrapped up my work at the office, treated myself to a therapeutic massage, and then met up with Chan.

The massage felt like a gift to my body. It's been working hard for a long time, and this was my way to showing some respect and care.

While I was there, I got the idea to prepare a small surprise for Chan. I went out of my way to find a flower shop and asked them to help me create a beautiful bouquet for her. Everything came together nicely. Now, let's see how things grow.

If she decides she doesn't want to meet me, or if there's no clear response from her, I may simple end up being someone she sees as a brother. And surprisingly, I'm okay with that. In the spirit of *stoicism*, I'm focusing on what I can control and letting go of expectations.

Today feels full in a good way. I'm heading to my ant Lan's place for dinner and then joining the Mochi class. It should be a fulfilling Friday.
