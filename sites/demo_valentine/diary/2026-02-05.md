# key takeaways 💭

*If yesterday were a short film, what would its title be...*
**Lovely Day**
After a productive workday, I waited for my date with Chan.

We met at 5:30PM and headed to the Crescent Mall to watch a movie. The animated film "Tiểu Yêu Quái Núi Lang Lang" was light, fun, and surprisingly thoughtful. We had dinner afterward at a steamed food restaurant inside the mall. We didn't focus much on the food, as we already felt full and more physically connected to each other.

Later, we walked around the crescent-shaped lake, crossed Starlight Bridge, and ended up sitting down on a grassy hill in the park. We talked, watched the stars, and shared some quiet physical closeness. It felt exciting, but also very calm. I leaned in for a first kiss, but the timing didn't feel quite right. That's okay. There will be another moment.
