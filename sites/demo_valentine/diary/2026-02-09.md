# key takeaways 💭


*How does my body feel right now(tired / okay / steady / energized)...*
I felt lively and full of love.

*If yesterday were a short film, what would its title be...*
**Romantic Titanic**

I picked Chan up around 5 PM. We spent time watching the sunset and flying kites together. Then we went to a Pho restaurant near my house for a light dinner before heading to my apartment. 

We were playful - almost like Tom and Jerry. While she tried to catch the movie, I kept leaning in for a kiss. She talked about her boundaries and why she wants to protect herself before anything becomes official. I understood her perspective and told her I was willing to wait.

After I opened up and shared my feelings, she pulled back slightly. Then she asked if I could teach her how to kiss - it was her first time. I told her not to worry and to just go with the flow.

We ended up sharing a deep kiss on the sofa. The kisses became deeper, and we felt the intensity, the body, and the rhythm together. I started as the active one, but gradually I let her take the lead.

The last kiss was strong and beautiful. It felt like we were fully present and give ourselves to the moment.

Later, I took her back home afterward and returned to my place. I arrived around 2 AM, and we exchanged a few messages before going to sleep.
