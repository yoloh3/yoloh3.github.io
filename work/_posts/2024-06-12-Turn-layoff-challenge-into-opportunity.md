This is a perspective from a senior software/hardware engineer's role to seek a new job.
I believe upgrading your knowledge and skills is essential to changing your current situation (e.g., being laid off).
So what specific steps does this include?

# Upgrade your CV
It is CV "upgrade," not "update"!
Start by reviewing your knowledge and experience at your previous companies using a brainstorming tool, like a mind map.
After getting a clear overview of your experience, read some articles on how to write a good CV from the perspectives of HR, a Director, and a Senior Engineer.
Then, begin writing your CV—not just once or twice, but every day, reviewing it frequently.

I recommend the following websites to master writing CVs:
- [How to Prepare a Good Resume](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2013/03/how-to-prepare-good-resume.html)
- [Engineering Resumes on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/wiki/index/)

# Upgrade your Linkedln

Again, I use the word "upgrade".  Have you used this social network effectively?
In my case, I use LinkedIn for:
- Technical communication within my domain.
- Reading news of interest (technology, business, experts' perspectives).
- Getting an overview of the market in my domain.

Connect with as many talented people as possible to gain opportunities; read numerous job requirements to understand your job market; and read posts from talented engineers to learn more.

# Seek a job

Now, let's focus on our primary goal: finding a new job.
First, complete steps 1) and 2) to prepare your **"food" (knowledge and connections)** and **"weapon" (CV)** before entering the job market.
Then, apply for all suitable jobs on LinkedIn (or other websites like VietnamWorks, TopCV, etc.) with your upgraded CV.
Additionally, contact recruiters directly with meaningful messages. Contact your connections (like Staff Engineers or Managers) and ask if they know of any opportunities.
I've given you a sturdy fishing rod, so let's go fishing!

I discovered a useful newsletter from [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/) that provides weekly insights on CV creation. Below is a snapshot of this week's newsletter, which focuses on the theme of "Career Growth."
